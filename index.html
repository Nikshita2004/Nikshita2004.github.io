			<h1>What is Passion?</h1>
			<p>Passion is something that you love so much that you would do it for your life. It is a desire for something, and that something usually gets you through tough times.</p>

			<h1>This is My Passion</h1>
			<p>I didn't really know what my passion was going to be, and I had to look at everything that I did to figure out what my passion would be. Finally, I chose something that I have been working on for the past 3 months. I chose coding, and that is my passion. Coding is what makes up all technology, whether it is an app or a phone. Code is like Google Drive, everyone could work on a project about code at the same time, making various changes. Examples that code could make: apps, phones, laptops/desktops, computers, websites, etc. There are many more. People just go on websites without knowing how the person made it. The website doesn't run itself!</p>

			<h1>What's my Goal?</h1>
			<p>My goal is to make websites and improve my skills of code. I want to make apps for the app store so that other people could play them. I want to help other people if they want to learn code, so that they could succeed in it. </p>
