			<h1>What Did I Learn About Myself?</h1>
			<p>I learned that I find many different ways to get to a goal, and I work towards that goal without giving up, most of the time. I use help from other people so that I could improve myself and I could get closer towards my goal.</p>

		<div class="how">
			<h1>How This Helps for Projects?</h1>
			<p>This helps because my passion is coding, and I use my knowledge of it to complete these assingments. If I ever become a website developer, I can use these skills to succeed in my goal. These skills can help me because these are the common skills that I need to help me in that career.</p>
			<p>In iExplore, we learn that we have to follow our passion, and we have different projects that allow us to explore what our passion is and how we can improve on the skills of our passion.</p>
