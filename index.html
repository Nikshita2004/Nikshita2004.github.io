			<h1>This is My Passion</h1>
			<p>My passion is coding. Coding is what makes up all technology, whether it is an app or a phone. Code is like Google Drive, everyone could work on a project about code at the same time, making various changes. Examples that code could make: apps, phones, laptops/desktops, computers, websites, etc. There are many more. People just go on websites without knowing how the person made it. The website doesn't run itself!</p>
